# Coding test for Python Developer Centrica

This is a coding test for a Python developer that can be sent to the user during an interview.
The challenge is not meant to take up a lot of time and is not _very_ hard.

The test is meant to serve as a starting point for the candidate to start from.
The interviewer(s) can look how the candidate interprets the test and during an interview
